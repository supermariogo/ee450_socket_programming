a. Full Name
   Ze Mao

b. Student ID 
   6077548939

c. What you have done in the assignment 
   everything in phase 1 2 3

d.What your code files are and what each one of them does.  
   auctionserver.c
   what server should do, 
   phase 1: as TCP server receive login info
   phase 2: as TCP server receive seller's itemlist
   phase 3: broadcast items and annouce result

   bidder.c
   what bidder should do, 
   phase 1: send login info to server
   phase 2: NULL
   phase 3: listen broadcast items and bid and receive result

   seller.c
   what seller should do, 
   phase 1: send login info to server
   phase 2: send items to server
   phase 3: receive result

   port.c
   some common functions that are used by bidder.c auctionserver.c seller.c
   
   MyList.c
   a functions set of list operation, used to store items from seller
   and
   auctionserver.h bidder.h seller.h port.h MyList.h 

e. What the TA should do to run your programs.  
   make
   ./server.o
   ./bidder1.o
   ./bidder2.o
   ./seller1.o
   ./seller2.o

f. The format of all the messages exchanged (other than what is mentioned in the project description).
   Ready#  is send from server to sync all processed in phase1 to guarantee all user has send login info
   name#10#30#40# is send from bidder to state his/her price for every item
   END# is send from server to users to terminal when no seller pass the authentication
   others are same with project description 

g. Any idiosyncrasy of your project. It should say under what conditions the project fails, if any.
   All conditions have been considered. Please have a test.
   Predefined Macros are used when compile.
   for examle:
   bidder1.o bidder2.o are both from bidder.c, 
   Predefined Macros: gcc -DSELLERX=1, gcc -DSELLERX=1 are used to distinguish different bidders
   This is more efficient and easy than fork() process.

h. Reused Code: Did you use code from anywhere for your project? 
   MyList.c is the code I wrote in CS402

----------------------------------------------
bonus points:

16. If you submit a makefile or a script file along with your project that helps us compile your codes more 
easily, you will receive 5 bonus points.

Makefile are used.

15. Using fork() or similar system calls are not mandatory however if you do use fork() or similar system files 
in your codes to create concurrent processes (or threads) and they function correctly you will receive 10 
bonus points.

concurrent threads (pthread) are used, you can have a check with the following command,
grep -n 'pthread' *.c

----------------------------------------------
The flow:

Phase1: authentication

server      <--------bidder1
2039 TCP    <--------bidder2
            <--------seller1
            <--------seller2


Phase2: seller send items

server      <--------seller1
2139 TCP    <--------seller2

Phase3: broadcat and annouce

server      -------->bidder1 4039  UDP
            -------->bidder2 4139  UDP

server      -------->bidder1 5039  TCP
            -------->bidder2 5139  TCP
            -------->seller1 3039  TCP
            -------->seller2 3139  TCP
