----------------------------------------------
The flow:

Phase1: authentication

server      <--------bidder1
2039 TCP    <--------bidder2
            <--------seller1
            <--------seller2


Phase2: seller send items

server      <--------seller1
2139 TCP    <--------seller2

Phase3: broadcat and annouce

server      -------->bidder1 4039  UDP
            -------->bidder2 4139  UDP

server      -------->bidder1 5039  TCP
            -------->bidder2 5139  TCP
            -------->seller1 3039  TCP
            -------->seller2 3139  TCP
